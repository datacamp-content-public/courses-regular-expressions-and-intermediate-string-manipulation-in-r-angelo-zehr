In this chapter we are going to learn to fuzzily match two data frames based on multiple conditions, using our own custom made matching functions.

`@script`
Often, we have more than one field in our datasets that we want to merge our data on. As strings are quite hard to match, if available, it's always a good idea to also take numbers into account. And that's exactly what we're going to do with our two lists of movie titles here.
In both tables we have a title and a year. But they do not align perfectly - neither the titles nor the years. Our goal is to have our list a with the external IDs from our list b.
