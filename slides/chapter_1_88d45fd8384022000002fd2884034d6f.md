In this chapter we are going to learn to fuzzily match two data frames based on multiple conditions, using our own custom made matching functions.

## Combining two fuzzy matches

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 13eba6a92f
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Often, we have more than one field in our datasets that we want to merge our data on. As strings are quite hard to match, if available, it's always a good idea to also take numbers into account. And that's exactly what we're going to do with our two lists of movie titles here.
In both tables we have a title and a year. But they do not align perfectly - neither the titles nor the years.

## Combining two fuzzy matches

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 45b72aa771
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Our goal is to have our list a with the external IDs from our list b. We will try to achieve this by matching the titles based on their string distances and the years by their closeness to each other.

## Fuzzy matches: Helper functions

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 1f0c3db714
```

`@part1`
For the string comparison:
```r
small_str_distance <- function(left, right) {
  stringdist(left, right) <= 3
}
```{{1}}
For the number comparison:
```r
close_to_each_other <- function(left, right) {
  abs(left - right) <= 2
}
```{{2}}

`@script`
So let's write our helper functions that we'll use for matching the two datasets. The first function will check whether the strings passed to it are alike. It does that using the stringdist function, that we've used before. It returns true if the two strings have a distance smaller or equal to three. It will get passed two columns: The title column from our first dataset (here called left) and the prod_title column from our second dataset (here called right).
The second function will be passed the two year columns. Here we write a simple function that checks whether the numbers in the left column are equal to the ones in the right column or have a difference smaller than two years.
